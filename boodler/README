This is the python part of the project which defines the listening agents and the tests sounds.

The agents are started to listen on a tcp port. The openframeworks app will then send messages on the port and the agent responds to these events.

To run the agent type
boodler --output pulse --listen --extern theagents com.example.theagents/Example
