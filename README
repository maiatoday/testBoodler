Test project which uses a basic TCP client derived from ofxTCPClient to send simple text messages to a listening boodler python script. The boodler script changes the sound it plays depending on the events it receives.

Needs extras ofxThread and ofxNetwork and is base on 0062.

install boodler as per boodler.org
if you are using ubuntu and pulse remember you also need libpulse-dev.

also you need some standard packages from boodler installed like this
boodle-mgr install http://boodler.org/lib/org.boodler.old.water.1.0.boop

after you have tested it works go to testBoodler/boodler and run:
boodler --listen --extern theagents com.example.theagents/Example
or in my case I use pulse so
boodler --output pulse --listen --extern theagents com.example.theagents/Example

Then run the opeframeworks project. Press the number keys 1,2,3,0 and hear the sounds change

You can also test the boodler part by typing
telnet localhost 31863

this will open a connection to the port
then typing in text such as:
start

should make a sound
